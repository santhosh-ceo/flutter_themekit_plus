## üöÄ Getting Started

### Installation

Add the package to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_themekit_plus: ^1.0.0
  provider: ^6.0.0
  shared_preferences: ^2.0.0
```
### Basic Setup
Wrap your MaterialApp with the ThemeKit widget to enable theming:
```
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_themekit_plus/flutter_themekit_plus.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ThemeKit(
      initialTheme: 'material',
      themes: ThemePacks.all,
      builder: (context, theme) => MaterialApp(
        theme: theme.light,
        darkTheme: theme.dark,
        themeMode: theme.mode,
        home: HomeScreen(),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```
### Switching Themes:
Switch themes dynamically using the `ThemeKitController`:
```
ThemeKitController.of(context).switchTheme('cyberpunk');
```
Toggle between light, dark, or system mode:
```
ThemeKitController.of(context).setThemeMode(ThemeMode.dark);
```
### Widgets and Usage:
All widgets are themed and support context-aware variants (primary, secondary, success, danger, info). They respect the active theme‚Äôs ColorScheme, typography, shapes, animations, and padding.

### Theme Packs

The package includes eight curated theme packs, each with light and dark variants:Material: Modern Material 3 design with dynamic colors (Material You support).
`Glassmorphism`: Translucent surfaces with blur effects.
`Pastel`: Soft, soothing colors for a clean aesthetic.
`Neumorphism`: 3D-like soft shadows and gradients.
`Cyberpunk`: Vibrant, neon colors for a futuristic look.
`Dracula`: High-contrast, developer-friendly palette.
`Minimal`: Clean, monochrome design with minimal styling.
`Solarized`: Balanced, eye-friendly colors for professional apps.

Access all themes via `ThemePacks.all` or individually (e.g., `ThemePacks.material`).

### Theme Extensions
Customize typography, shapes, animations, and padding:TypographyConfig: Defines styles for heading1, heading2, body, caption, and button.
ShapeConfig: Controls corner radius for widgets.
AnimationConfig: Specifies curves and durations for transitions.
PaddingConfig: Standardizes padding for buttons, cards, etc.

Example:
```
ThemeExtensions(
  typography: TypographyConfig(
    heading1: TextStyle(fontSize: 32, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
  ),
  shapes: ShapeConfig(cornerRadius: 12.0),
  animations: AnimationConfig(curve: Curves.easeInOut, duration: Duration(milliseconds: 300)),
